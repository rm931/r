<h2>From Parcels to People: Development of a Spatially Explicit Risk Indicator to Monitor Residential Pesticide Exposure in Agricultural Areas</h2>
<h2><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>Pesticide use in agriculture is a growing concern due to its effects on biodiversity, ecosystems, and human health, particularly for people living near agricultural areas. This study introduces a <strong>spatially explicit risk indicator</strong> to monitor <strong>residential exposure to pesticides</strong>, leveraging high-resolution pesticide application data from France. The method integrates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parcel-level pesticide load mapping</strong> using plant protection product (PPP) sales data,</li>
<li><strong>Population distribution modeling</strong>, and</li>
<li><strong>Exposure risk calculations</strong> based on EFSA guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Findings suggest that <strong>13% of the French population</strong> resides near pesticide-treated crops, with <strong>26% experiencing moderate to high exposure levels</strong>. The risk indicator enables targeted <strong>policy interventions</strong> and <strong>sustainable land management</strong> strategies across the EU. It is scalable for <strong>EU-wide monitoring</strong>, supporting the <strong>European Green Deal</strong> and <strong>Zero Pollution Action Plan</strong>.</p>

<h1><strong>Thematic Area: </strong>Biodiversity<strong> and Ecosystem Services</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Accounting for Ecosystems and their Services in the European Union (INCA)</strong></h2>
<p>The report focuses on ecosystem accounting in the EU, assessing ecosystem extent, condition, and services using an integrated approach.</p>
<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>The INCA (Integrated system of Natural Capital and ecosystem services Accounting) project, initiated in 2015, aims to develop a pilot for an integrated system of ecosystem accounts for the EU.</p>
<p>The <strong>INCA project</strong> aims to establish a pilot system for <strong>ecosystem accounting</strong> in the EU, integrating ecological and economic data to quantify natural capital. The study applies the <strong>System of Environmental-Economic Accounting &ndash; Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA)</strong> framework to develop accounts for ecosystem <strong>extent, condition, and services</strong>. It follows the SEEA (System of Environmental-Economic Accounting) framework, producing ecosystem extent, condition, and services accounts. The report summarizes key results of the project, demonstrating the feasibility of ecosystem accounting at the EU scale. Findings indicate changes in ecosystem extent, variations in ecosystem condition, and the economic value of ecosystem services, contributing significantly to EU policy-making and sustainability goals.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ecosystem extent trends (2000&ndash;2018):</strong> Urban areas expanded by 5.8%, while cropland, grasslands, and inland wetlands declined.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem condition:</strong> Forest health indicators showed mixed trends, with nitrogen pollution decreasing but defoliation increasing. Agro-ecosystems saw a moderate rise in organic farming (+55%) but continued biodiversity decline.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem services valuation:</strong> The total annual value of <strong>seven key ecosystem services</strong> (e.g., carbon sequestration, water purification, pollination) in the EU was estimated at <strong>&euro;172 billion in 2012</strong>.<br /> The report highlights ecosystem accounting as a crucial tool for <strong>evidence-based policymaking</strong>, supporting initiatives like the <strong>EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</strong> and the <strong>European Green Deal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Research Problem</strong></h4>
<p>The report addresses the <strong>lack of systematic, standardized ecosystem accounting</strong> in the EU. Despite ecosystems providing critical services&mdash;such as carbon sequestration, pollination, and water purification&mdash;there is no unified method to integrate them into <strong>economic decision-making</strong>. The INCA project seeks to bridge this gap by applying <strong>ecosystem accounting</strong> based on the <strong>SEEA EA</strong> framework.</p>

<p>Landscape Features Support Natural Pest Control and Farm Income When Pesticide</p>
<h2><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>This study evaluates the role of landscape features supporting natural pest control (LF-NPC) in maintaining agricultural productivity under reduced pesticide use. Using the European Union as a case study, the research integrates granular farm-level data, a high-resolution LF-NPC potential map, and a regional agro-economic supply model. The findings reveal that farms in high LF-NPC potential areas experience lower productivity losses under pesticide reduction policies. The results indicate that LF-NPC reduces yield gaps by approximately 4 percentage points and enhances farm income by a similar margin. These insights provide a strong foundation for policies promoting landscape-based solutions to mitigate the effects of pesticide reduction targets outlined in the <em>European Green Deal</em> and the <em>Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Summary</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Research Problem</strong></h3>
<p>With global and EU policies targeting a 50% reduction in pesticide use by 2030, there is concern over potential productivity losses in agriculture. This study investigates whether landscape features that enhance natural pest control can compensate for pesticide reductions and support farm incomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Sources:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yield observations from the <em>EU Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN)</em></li>
<li>A high-resolution (100m) LF-NPC potential map based on landscape complexity and field observations</li>
<li>A European agro-economic model (<em>CAPRI</em> - Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact Modeling System)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yield gap estimation:</strong> Differences between organic and conventional farming yields were calculated using regression models, isolating the impact of pesticide use.</li>
<li><strong>LF-NPC impact quantification:</strong> A mixed-effects model was employed to evaluate the relationship between regional LF-NPC potential and yield gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Economic modeling:</strong> CAPRI was used to project agricultural economic outcomes under a pesticide reduction scenario.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Key Findings</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Yield gaps due to pesticide reduction:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Average yield gap between organic and conventional farming attributed to pesticide use was <strong>-15%</strong>, with variations across crops (e.g., -8% for legumes, -23% for rye).</li>
<li>Higher LF-NPC potential regions exhibited smaller yield gaps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Landscape features mitigate productivity loss:</strong>
<ul>
<li>LF-NPC potential was <strong>positively correlated</strong> with reduced yield gaps in 9 out of 10 analyzed crops.</li>
<li>A <strong>one-unit increase in LF-NPC</strong> potential resulted in a <strong>4 percentage point reduction in yield gap</strong> on average.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Economic benefits:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>one-unit increase in LF-NPC</strong> potential led to a <strong>7% increase in farm revenue</strong> and a <strong>4.2% increase in farm income</strong> per hectare.</li>
<li>Financial benefits varied across regions due to differences in agricultural structure and crop types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Policy relevance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The study provides quantitative evidence that LF-NPC can help achieve pesticide reduction targets while supporting economic viability.</li>
<li>Certain crops (e.g., cereals) are more reliant on synthetic pesticides, necessitating targeted policy support.</li>

<h2>Bee Pollination Outperforms Pesticides for Oilseed Crop Production and Profitability</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>The study evaluates the relative contributions of <strong>bee pollination and pesticide use</strong> to <strong>oilseed rape (OSR) yield and farm profitability</strong>. While OSR can self-pollinate, bee pollination significantly enhances seed yield. However, pesticide use negatively affects pollinators, potentially reducing these benefits.</p>
<p>Using a <strong>large-scale dataset of 294 OSR fields</strong> (2013-2016) in France, the study quantifies the <strong>individual and combined effects of pesticide application, soil quality, and pollinator abundance</strong> on crop yield and farm economics. Findings indicate that <strong>increasing pollinator abundance leads to 15-40% higher yield and gross margins</strong>, while pesticides do not significantly increase yields but reduce profitability due to high costs. The study highlights the economic and ecological benefits of <strong>nature-based solutions (NBS)</strong> in agriculture.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Summary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Research Problem</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade-off between pollination services and pesticide use</strong>: Pesticides may control pests but can harm pollinators, reducing their positive effects on yield.</li>

<h2>A Screening Study of the Spatial Distribution and Cumulative Toxicity of Agricultural Pesticides in the European Union&rsquo;s Waters</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>This study evaluates the distribution and cumulative toxicity of 148 pesticide active substances (AS) across the European Union&rsquo;s water bodies. Due to data scarcity and limited monitoring, the researchers employ a screening-level model to estimate pesticide concentrations in soil and water. The model's predictions are validated against monitoring data, showing reasonable alignment. Findings indicate that while individual pesticide toxicity remains below 0.1 toxic units (TU) in most areas, cumulative toxicity exceeds 0.1 TU in 27% of the EU&rsquo;s stream network and 1 TU in 4%. A small number of active substances dominate the cumulative toxicity burden, though variations exist between locations. The study highlights the need for improved pesticide monitoring and more comprehensive emission data to refine EU pesticide policy assessments.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Summary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Research Problem</strong></h4>
<p>Agricultural pesticides pose a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems, but their spatial distribution and cumulative toxicity remain inadequately characterized due to data limitations and inconsistent monitoring efforts across the EU.</p>
<h4><strong>Methodology</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Estimates of pesticide emissions from previous research, soil and water monitoring data, and chemical property databases.</li>
<li><strong>Modeling Approach:</strong> A steady-state screening-level model is used to predict pesticide concentrations in soil and water, incorporating pesticide degradation, runoff, leaching, and direct losses.</li>
<li><strong>Toxicity Assessment:</strong> Toxic units (TU) are calculated using the concentration addition (CA) model, where pesticide concentrations are divided by their no observed effect concentration (NOEC) for aquatic species.</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Model predictions are compared with observed pesticide concentrations from EU monitoring datasets.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Findings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pesticide Distribution:</strong> Estimated concentrations in water bodies generally align with monitoring data, though model limitations exist.</li>
<li><strong>Cumulative Toxicity:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Over <strong>27%</strong> of EU stream networks have cumulative toxicity exceeding <strong>0.1 TU</strong>, suggesting potential ecological harm.</li>
<li>More than <strong>4%</strong> of streams exceed <strong>1 TU</strong>, indicating high-risk zones.</li>
<li>Only <strong>~20 AS out of 148</strong> consistently contribute to the highest toxicity levels.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Regional Differences:</strong> Southern and Eastern Europe show higher cumulative toxicity levels, likely due to agricultural intensity and pesticide usage patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusions</strong></h4>
<p>While individual pesticide risks are low, their cumulative effects present widespread ecological concerns. The study underscores the need for improved pesticide use data, enhanced environmental monitoring, and policy adaptations to mitigate pesticide-driven water pollution.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Spatially Explicit Economic Effects of Non-Susceptible Pests' Invasion on Bt Maize</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>The paper investigates the economic and ecological consequences of secondary pest outbreaks in Bt maize fields. Bt maize, engineered to express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1Ab toxin, effectively controls primary pests such as the Mediterranean and European Corn Borers. However, the widespread adoption of Bt maize may create ideal conditions for non-susceptible secondary pests, such as the True Armyworm, leading to potential economic losses.</p>
<p>The study utilizes a <strong>spatially explicit bio-economic model</strong> to simulate pest population dynamics, economic impacts, and potential mitigation strategies in Arag&oacute;n, Spain. Results indicate that Bt maize reduces insecticide use and provides economic benefits but may inadvertently facilitate the spread of secondary pests. The study highlights the necessity of <strong>early detection and integrated pest management strategies</strong> to mitigate negative economic impacts.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Summary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Research Problem</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Bt maize is effective in controlling primary pests but may alter ecosystem dynamics, encouraging secondary pest outbreaks.</li>
<li>If secondary pest populations are not managed, they may cause significant crop losses despite continued Bt maize adoption.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Methodologies Used</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>spatially explicit bio-economic model</strong> based on population dynamics, movement ecology, economic parameters, and pest management strategies.</li>
<li>Model simulations run for <strong>25 years</strong> with five scenarios based on different levels of Bt maize adoption and three pest management strategies:</li>
<ol>
<li><strong>Insecticides used in both Bt and conventional maize fields.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insecticides used only in conventional maize fields.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No insecticide application.</strong></li>
</ol>
<li>The model incorporates real-world <strong>landscape data from Arag&oacute;n, Spain</strong>, using geographic land-use data to simulate pest spread.</li>
<li>Economic loss calculations are based on <strong>Net Present Value (NPV) over 25 years</strong>, factoring in <strong>pest-induced yield losses</strong> and <strong>insecticide expenditures</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Main Findings &amp; Conclusions</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bt maize farmers had a 74% higher profit per hectare compared to conventional farmers.</strong></li>
<li>Bt maize reduced <strong>insecticide applications by 68%</strong>, leading to environmental benefits.</li>
<li>True Armyworm, a non-target pest, <strong>spread extensively</strong>, invading 47-50% of Arag&oacute;n, despite pest control efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Insecticide application had minimal effect on controlling the secondary pest</strong>, as True Armyworm rapidly dispersed across fields.</li>
<li><strong>Expanding Bt maize area increases economic benefits but also enhances secondary pest spread</strong>, creating long-term risks.</li>
<li><strong>Early detection and regional coordination of pest control strategies are essential</strong> to mitigate economic losses from secondary pest outbreaks.</li>

<h2><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>This study presents an <strong>EU-wide crop diversity assessment</strong> using <strong>Earth Observation (EO) data and farmers&rsquo; declarations</strong>, aiming to enhance <strong>Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) monitoring</strong>. A new <strong>10m resolution crop diversity map for 2018</strong> is generated using the <strong>Shannon diversity index</strong>. The study finds that EU-wide crop diversity ranges from <strong>2.6 (p10) to 5.3 (p90), with a median of 3.9</strong>. A case study in the Netherlands compares EO-based crop diversity estimates with <strong>farmers&rsquo; declarations from 2009&ndash;2021</strong>, showing strong spatial agreement (<strong>R&sup2; = 0.62</strong>) and evidence of a <strong>positive response to CAP greening measures since 2014</strong>. The integration of <strong>Copernicus High-Resolution Crop Layers</strong> and parcel-level data could <strong>enhance agricultural policy monitoring and spatial targeting</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Summary</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Research Problem</strong></h3>
<p>Modern agricultural landscapes are characterized by declining crop diversity due to intensification. Crop diversity is crucial for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stabilizing food production</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reducing environmental impacts</strong> (e.g., lowering pest pressure, minimizing pesticide use)</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing climate resilience</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although the <strong>CAP requires crop diversification</strong>, systematic monitoring has been limited due to the <strong>lack of a harmonized EU-wide database</strong>. This study leverages <strong>EO-based and farmers&rsquo; declaration data</strong> to fill this gap.</p>
<h3><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crop Diversity Metric:</strong>

</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Key Findings</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>EU Crop Diversity (2018)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Crop diversity ranges from <strong>6 to 5.3</strong>, with a median of <strong>3.9</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Higher diversity in Mediterranean regions</strong>; lower in <strong>Scandinavia and mono-cropping areas</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Forest-dominated areas have lower crop diversity</strong>, requiring differentiated policy approaches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>EO vs. Farmers&rsquo; Declarations (Netherlands, 2018)</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Significant increase in crop diversity after 2015</strong>, suggesting a <strong>positive impact of CAP greening measures</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Chow Test confirms 2015 as a break-point</strong> for increasing diversity.</li>
<li><strong>Spatial variation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Southern Netherlands (horticulture areas) showed strongest gains</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Sandy soils in the east/north remain low in diversity</strong>, likely due to dominance of maize for livestock feed.</li>

<h2>Sustainability and Resilience against Climate Change Provided by a Territorial Crop-Livestock System</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>This study evaluates the sustainability and resilience of territorial crop-livestock systems (TCLS) under climate change conditions. The research focuses on a case study in the Vend&eacute;e region of France, where arable farms produce pulses to supply livestock farms with high-protein feed, aiming for local protein self-sufficiency. Using the <strong>MAELIA</strong> integrated assessment and modeling platform, the study assesses the socio-economic and environmental impacts of this farming system under two climate scenarios (<strong>RCP2.6</strong> and <strong>RCP8.5</strong>) up to 2050. Results indicate that the TCLS model improves socio-economic sustainability and climate mitigation but raises concerns over environmental impacts such as pesticide use and water quality degradation. While TCLS enhances resilience by increasing resistance to climate shocks, it also introduces greater variability in key performance indicators.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Summary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Research Problem</strong></h4>
<p>Agricultural systems face increasing climate-related risks, including extreme weather events affecting crop yields, economic viability, and food security. Conventional specialized farming models are often vulnerable to such disturbances. This study explores whether <strong>territorial crop-livestock integration</strong> (where arable farms and livestock farms exchange resources) can enhance resilience and sustainability.</p>
<h4><strong>Methodology</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Study:</strong> A group of seven farms (five arable, two livestock) in Vend&eacute;e, France.</li>
<li><strong>Modeling Platform:</strong><strong>MAELIA</strong> (an agent-based, high-resolution integrated assessment model).</li>
<li><strong>Climate Scenarios:</strong> RCP2.6 (low emissions) and RCP8.5 (high emissions) projected until 2050.</li>
<li><strong>Scenarios Tested:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baseline Scenario:</strong> Farms operate independently.</li>
<li><strong>Synergetic Scenario:</strong> Arable farms grow pulses (peas and fava beans) for livestock feed.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Sustainability &amp; Resilience Metrics:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Gross margin, economic dependency, energy/protein yield.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Nitrogen supply, carbon storage, water regulation, GHG emissions, pesticide use.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> Workload variation.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean Performance Levels:</strong> Average indicator values over the study period.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience Indicators:</strong> Variability, trend over time, and resistance to shocks.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Findings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protein yield increased by 10%</strong> due to grain legume cultivation.</li>
<li><strong>Gross margins improved by 5%</strong>, reducing dependency on external feed inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Workload decreased by 7%</strong>, though variability in labor increased.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Environmental Trade-offs:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nitrogen supply improved (+11%)</strong>, benefiting soil fertility.</li>
<li><strong>GHG emissions decreased by 13%</strong>, enhancing climate mitigation.</li>
<li><strong>Water quality regulation declined (-2%)</strong>, and <strong>pesticide use rose (+21%)</strong> due to legume cultivation.</li>
<li><strong>Carbon storage slightly decreased (-10%)</strong>, likely due to reduced crop residue inputs.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Resilience Implications:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resistance to climate shocks improved</strong>, meaning TCLS can better withstand extreme events.</li>
<li>However, <strong>variability in key indicators increased</strong>, suggesting greater uncertainty.</li>
<li>Trends in economic and environmental performance indicators showed mixed results.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusions</strong></h4>
<p>TCLS <strong>enhances socio-economic resilience and climate mitigation but has mixed environmental effects</strong>. The findings highlight a <strong>trade-off</strong> between economic benefits and environmental concerns, particularly regarding pesticide use and nitrogen leaching. The study emphasizes the need for optimized management strategies, such as intercropping and organic amendments, to mitigate negative impacts.</p>

<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>The study examines how agroecology can address the limitations of intensive agriculture, which has led to environmental degradation, yield stagnation, and socio-economic disparities. Agroecology integrates biodiversity into farming systems to enhance ecosystem functions such as pollination, pest control, and soil fertility.

<h2><strong>Experimental and Empirical Evidence Shows That Reducing Weed Control in Winter Cereal Fields is a Viable Strategy for Farmers</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>The study evaluates the economic and agronomic viability of reducing <strong>weed control and nitrogen (N) inputs</strong> in <strong>winter cereal fields</strong>, particularly in wheat production. Intensive agricultural systems rely heavily on <strong>herbicides and synthetic fertilizers</strong>, leading to environmental degradation and high production costs. However, the impact of reducing these inputs on yield and profitability remains uncertain.</p>
<p>By implementing a <strong>two-factor experimental design</strong> across <strong>55 fields in France</strong>, the study quantifies the effects of reduced weed management and N inputs under <strong>real farming conditions</strong>. The results demonstrate that <strong>lowering agrochemical inputs does not necessarily reduce yields</strong> but instead can improve <strong>gross margins</strong> due to reduced costs. The findings support <strong>agroecological farming transitions</strong> and provide empirical evidence to <strong>inform EU policies on sustainable agriculture</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Summary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Research Problem</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The widespread use of <strong>herbicides and nitrogen fertilizers</strong> in conventional agriculture leads to negative <strong>environmental and economic externalities</strong>, including soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and high production costs.</li>
<li>Farmers are reluctant to reduce input use due to the <strong>assumed yield losses and economic risks</strong>.</li>
<li>The study aims to <strong>quantify the agronomic and economic impacts</strong> of reducing weed control and nitrogen inputs in winter cereal fields, addressing key gaps in agricultural sustainability research.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Methodologies Used</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experimental Design:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two-factor approach</strong> manipulating <strong>weed control intensity</strong> and <strong>N inputs</strong> in <strong>55 fields</strong> across <strong>23 farms</strong> in the LTSER Zone Atelier &ldquo;Plaine &amp; Val de S&egrave;vre&rdquo; (France).</li>
<li>Treatments included <strong>no weed control, reduced weed control, full weed control, and different levels of nitrogen application</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yield and Economic Assessments:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Yield measurements were conducted using <strong>1 m&sup2; quadrats</strong> per treatment.</li>
<li>Economic evaluation used <strong>gross margin analysis</strong> (total revenue minus variable costs).</li>
<li>The study included <strong>survey data from farmers</strong> and <strong>statistical modeling</strong> to assess the relationships between input levels, yield, and profitability.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Main Findings &amp; Conclusions</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reducing weed control and nitrogen inputs does not necessarily reduce yields</strong> in conventional or organic systems.</li>
<li>Farmers using <strong>high nitrogen levels (&gt;120 kg/ha)</strong> could <strong>increase profitability by reducing weed control</strong>, as yield remained stable but costs decreased.</li>
<li><strong>Organic farming systems</strong> had <strong>lower yields but higher profitability</strong> due to significantly lower input costs.</li>
<li><strong>Gross margins increased by up to 21.4% when reducing both nitrogen and weed control intensity.</strong></li>
<li>The study challenges the <strong>assumption that higher inputs = higher profitability</strong> and suggests that <strong>many farmers could optimize input use without compromising economic returns</strong>.</li>

Despite crop diversification's recognized benefits, its <strong>trade-offs, long-term effects, and barriers to implementation remain underexplored</strong>.</p>
<p>The study introduces <strong>a set of 32 sustainability indicators</strong> covering <strong>economic, environmental, and social dimensions</strong>. These indicators assess the <strong>performance of diversified cropping systems</strong> and were tested in <strong>France, Germany, and Italy</strong> through <strong>case studies</strong>. Results show that crop diversification can improve sustainability, but <strong>economic and agronomic trade-offs exist</strong>, requiring tailored policy and stakeholder engagement.</p>

<h1><strong>Thematic Area: Circular economy and sustainability</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>&nbsp;F</strong>ostering local crop-livestock integration via legume exchanges using an innovative integrated assessment and modelling approach based on the MAELIA platform</h2>
<p><strong>The study explores integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) as a strategy to enhance resource efficiency, self-sufficiency, and sustainability in agriculture.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>The study assesses the potential of integrating crop and livestock farming through local legume exchanges to enhance agricultural sustainability, self-sufficiency, and resilience. Using the MAELIA platform&mdash;an agent-based, integrated assessment and modeling tool&mdash;the researchers evaluated three scenarios of increasing cooperation among five arable and two livestock farms in western France. The most ambitious, synergy-driven scenario enabled full self-sufficiency in local protein supply while improving economic returns, reducing nitrogen fertilizer use by 11%, and lowering workload by 5%. The results highlight the benefits of territorial crop-livestock integration (TCLS) in reducing reliance on external inputs and fostering agroecological transitions, provided adequate institutional and financial support is available.</p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Research Problem</strong></h4>
<p>Modern intensive farming systems face sustainability challenges due to their reliance on external inputs (e.g., synthetic fertilizers, imported feed) and their vulnerability to market fluctuations. Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) could enhance resilience and sustainability, but their adoption is hindered by economic, logistical, and policy barriers. This study examines how territorial crop-livestock integration (TCLS) through legume exchanges can address these challenges.</p>
<h4><strong>Methodologies</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modeling Approach</strong>: The MAELIA agent-based modeling platform was used to simulate interactions among soil, climate, cropping practices, and farm operations at the field level.</li>
<li><strong>Participatory Design</strong>: Farmers, agricultural advisors, and scientists co-designed three exchange scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Scenarios Tested</strong>:
<ol>
<li><strong>Coexistence</strong> &ndash; Farmers trade without changing existing cropping patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Complementarity</strong> &ndash; Arable farmers introduce legumes to partially meet livestock needs.</li>
<li><strong>Synergy</strong> &ndash; Farmers actively coordinate crop planning to fully meet livestock protein needs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Indicators</strong>: Self-sufficiency, economic performance (gross margin, efficiency), environmental impact (fertilizer use, pesticide application), and labor requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Findings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synergistic Integration Achieves Full Self-Sufficiency</strong>: The most cooperative scenario met 100% of the livestock farms' protein needs, eliminating reliance on imported soybean meal.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Benefits</strong>: The synergy scenario increased territorial gross margin by 4% (&euro;71/ha) and reduced feed costs for livestock farmers by 12%.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Gains</strong>: Nitrogen fertilizer use decreased by 11% (21 kg N/ha), reducing dependency on synthetic inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Efficiency</strong>: The synergistic approach lowered labor time by 5% (12 min/ha), spreading workloads more evenly.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Trade-offs</strong>: The only downside observed was a slight increase in pesticide use (+2%), likely due to legume cultivation requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusions</strong></h4>
<p>The study demonstrates that TCLS can enhance agricultural sustainability while maintaining economic viability. However, broader adoption requires institutional support, including cooperative agreements, financial incentives, and advisory services.</p>
<h2><strong>Expertise Demonstration (Projects, Methodologies, Outcomes)</strong></h2>
<p>This study aligns with research on agroecological transition, resource-efficient food production, and agent-based modeling for decision support. The MAELIA platform's ability to integrate climate, soil, and socio-economic variables makes it a valuable tool for scenario analysis. The study's methodology could be applied to other regions, particularly in the EU, where policy-driven sustainability transitions are a priority.</p>
<p>The modeling approach mirrors frameworks used in European Commission projects, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DiverIMPACTS (Horizon 2020)</strong> &ndash; Investigating crop diversification strategies.</li>
<li><strong>AGFORWARD (FP7)</strong> &ndash; Exploring sustainable agricultural systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methodologies could be extended to evaluate circular economy initiatives in agri-food systems, particularly within <strong>EU Green Deal objectives</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>EU Policy Relevance and Impact</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>Alignment with EU Sustainability Goals</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>European Green Deal &amp; Farm to Fork Strategy</strong>: Supports sustainable food systems by reducing reliance on imported protein sources and synthetic inputs.</li>
<li><strong>CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) Reform</strong>: Demonstrates the need for financial incentives to promote mixed farming and territorial cooperation.</li>
<li><strong>Nitrogen Use Efficiency Targets</strong>: The reduction in synthetic fertilizer aligns with EU objectives for nutrient efficiency and water protection (e.g., <strong>Nitrates Directive</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Policy Development and Implementation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>CAP Eco-Schemes &amp; Agri-Environment Measures</strong>: The study suggests that targeted support (e.g., for legume production and on-farm feed processing) could incentivize ICLS adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Rural Development Programs</strong>: Results highlight the potential for place-based policies supporting farmer collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Regulatory &amp; Decision-Making Implications</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The study provides empirical evidence supporting a shift towards <strong>territorialized food systems</strong>, in line with <strong>EU circular economy</strong> and <strong>local food chain</strong></li>
<li>It underlines the role of <strong>spatial planning</strong> in optimizing farm-level synergies, which could inform <strong>CAP strategic plans</strong> at the national level.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Final Remarks</strong></h2>
<p>This study offers concrete, data-driven insights into how <strong>crop-livestock synergies</strong> can contribute to <strong>sustainable and circular agricultural systems</strong>. The use of <strong>integrated assessment models (IAM)</strong> like MAELIA provides a robust framework for scenario planning and policy evaluation, making it a valuable tool for EU <strong>evidence-based policymaking</strong>.</p>

<p>Assessment of Impacts on the Environment</p>
<h2>Coupling MAELIA and Territorial Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to Evaluate the Environmental Performance of Territorial Crop-Livestock Systems</h2>
<h2><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>This study develops an innovative methodology for <strong>assessing the environmental impacts</strong> of <strong>territorial crop-livestock systems (TCLS)</strong> by integrating <strong>MAELIA</strong>, an agent-based <strong>Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)</strong>, with <strong>Territorial Life Cycle Assessment (T-LCA)</strong>. The research applies this framework to a <strong>case study in Vend&eacute;e, France</strong>, comparing a <strong>baseline scenario</strong> (global market-dependent) with a <strong>synergetic scenario</strong> (local exchange of agricultural inputs such as feed and manure). Results indicate that the <strong>synergetic scenario</strong> reduces <strong>climate change impacts (GHG emissions), resource depletion, and ecosystem degradation</strong> while improving <strong>local protein self-sufficiency and economic performance</strong>. The study enhances <strong>environmental impact assessment methodologies</strong> by combining <strong>spatially and temporally explicit data</strong> with <strong>life cycle approaches</strong>, making it relevant for <strong>EU environmental policy development</strong> (e.g., Green Deal, CAP, Farm to Fork Strategy).</p>

<h2><strong>&nbsp;Managing Maize Under Pest Species Competition: Is Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) Maize the Solution?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>The study evaluates the ecological and economic implications of growing Bt maize, particularly in the context of competition between primary and secondary pest species. While Bt maize effectively controls primary pests such as the Mediterranean corn borer (<em>Sesamia nonagrioides</em>), it may inadvertently create favorable conditions for secondary pests like the true armyworm (<em>Mythimna unipuncta</em>), which are less susceptible to Bt toxins. Using a <strong>bioeconomic model</strong>, the study analyzes pest population dynamics, insecticide use, and economic outcomes over time. The findings indicate that while Bt maize can reduce insecticide use, secondary pest outbreaks may require additional pest management measures, potentially eroding its benefits.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Summary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Research Problem:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Bt maize was introduced to reduce dependency on broad-spectrum insecticides while effectively controlling major pests such as the European and Mediterranean corn borers.</li>
<li>However, <strong>secondary pest outbreaks</strong> have emerged as an unintended consequence, possibly offsetting the benefits of Bt technology.</li>
<li>The study examines how secondary pests interact with primary pests, how farmers respond to these changes, and whether Bt maize remains a sustainable solution.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Methodology:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>bioeconomic model</strong> incorporating pest population dynamics, maize yield, and economic variables.</li>
<li><strong>Lotka-Volterra equations</strong> to model competition between the primary (<em>Sesamia nonagrioides</em>) and secondary (<em>Mythimna unipuncta</em>) pests.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic nonlinear optimization (Differential Evolution method)</strong> to determine optimal pest control strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario analysis</strong>, comparing Bt maize adoption with and without insecticide applications.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Findings:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bt maize adoption initially reduces insecticide use</strong> but may lead to secondary pest outbreaks over time.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary pests proliferate when primary pests are suppressed</strong>, leading to new pest control challenges.</li>
<li>Farmers who rely <strong>only on Bt maize</strong> (without insecticides) face yield losses due to secondary pests.</li>
<li><strong>Insecticide applications remain necessary</strong> to control secondary pests, reducing the overall environmental benefits of Bt maize.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies</strong>, including selective insecticide use and conservation of natural enemies, can help mitigate secondary pest risks.</li>
<li><strong>Economic implications</strong>: Bt maize provides higher net returns than conventional maize, but profits decline if secondary pests require additional treatments.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>3. Expertise Demonstration</strong></h3>
<p>The study applies advanced <strong>bioeconomic modeling</strong> to assess environmental and economic impacts, providing insights relevant to integrated pest management (IPM) and agricultural sustainability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bioeconomic modeling techniques</strong> for pest population dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Ecological risk assessment</strong> of GM crops.</li>
<li><strong>Pest competition analysis</strong> using Lotka-Volterra models.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic optimization for decision-making</strong> in agricultural management.</li>
<li><strong>Policy evaluation frameworks</strong> for sustainable agricultural practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methodologies align with environmental impact assessment strategies used in EU agricultural policy evaluation and contribute to evidence-based decision-making.</p>
<h3><strong>4. EU Policy Relevance and Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This study has significant policy implications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common Agricultural Policy (CAP):</strong> Demonstrates the need for adaptive pest management strategies in sustainable agriculture.</li>
<li><strong>European Green Deal &amp; Farm to Fork Strategy:</strong> Highlights risks associated with reduced pesticide use in Bt crop systems.</li>
<li><strong>EU GMO Regulation &amp; Risk Assessment:</strong> Reinforces the necessity of <strong>post-market environmental monitoring</strong> of GM crops.</li>

<h2><strong>The Impact of Secondary Pests on Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Crops</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>This review examines the unintended ecological effects of genetically modified (GM) Bt crops, particularly the emergence of secondary pests. While Bt crops reduce the need for chemical insecticides and effectively control primary target pests, their widespread adoption has led to unexpected ecological consequences. The paper identifies three main causes of secondary pest outbreaks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduction in broad-spectrum insecticide applications</strong> &ndash; This allows non-target pests to proliferate.</li>
<li><strong>Decline in natural enemy populations</strong> &ndash; As certain prey species decline, natural predator-prey dynamics are disrupted.</li>
<li><strong>Niche replacement by non-susceptible pests</strong> &ndash; When Bt-resistant pests emerge, they exploit the ecological gap left by suppressed primary pests.</li>
</ol>
<p>The study underscores the need for long-term ecological monitoring and integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to ensure the sustainability of Bt crop technology.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Summary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Research Problem:</strong></h4>
<p>Bt crops, engineered to express insecticidal proteins from <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>, were designed to reduce dependency on chemical insecticides and improve pest management. However, concerns have emerged regarding their long-term ecological impact, particularly the rise of secondary pest populations that were previously of minor economic significance.</p>
<h4><strong>Methodology:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Review of existing literature on Bt crops, their impact on agro-ecosystems, and documented cases of secondary pest outbreaks.</li>
<li>Analysis of pest dynamics, insecticide usage trends, and ecological interactions in Bt cotton and Bt maize fields worldwide.</li>
<li>Assessment of the role of natural enemies in maintaining pest population balance.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Findings:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bt Cotton:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Initially led to a <strong>60% reduction in insecticide use</strong>, but within a decade, secondary pests (e.g., mirid bugs, whiteflies) became major concerns, requiring renewed insecticide applications.</li>
<li>In China and India, farmers had to increase insecticide spraying to control secondary pests, diminishing the initial economic and environmental benefits of Bt cotton.</li>
<li>In the USA, secondary pest outbreaks (e.g., stinkbugs) have been managed with targeted insecticides, though the overall ecological balance remains altered.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Bt Maize:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Western Bean Cutworm (WBC)</strong> emerged as a major secondary pest due to its <strong>low susceptibility</strong> to Bt toxins, leading to significant economic losses in North America.</li>
<li>In Europe, secondary pests like the <strong>true armyworm</strong> and the <strong>Western Corn Rootworm</strong> gained prominence, particularly as Bt maize adoption expanded.</li>
<li>In Argentina, the <strong>corn leafhopper</strong>, a vector for plant pathogens, became an emerging threat.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Mechanisms Behind Secondary Pest Proliferation:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced insecticide use</strong> led to the <strong>resurgence of pests previously controlled indirectly</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Decline in predator species</strong> allowed non-target pests to thrive.</li>
<li><strong>Ecological niche replacement</strong> enabled minor pest species to exploit gaps left by eliminated primary pests.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Long-Term Risks:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>Increased reliance on chemical insecticides to manage secondary pests.</li>
<li>Potential resistance evolution in both primary and secondary pest populations.</li>
<li>Disruption of natural enemy populations, weakening biological pest control mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3><strong>3. Expertise Demonstration</strong></h3>
<p>This research aligns with key methodologies used in environmental impact assessment and ecological risk analysis of GM crops.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta-analysis techniques</strong> were applied to review secondary pest trends.</li>
<li><strong>Agro-ecosystem modeling</strong> was used to predict long-term effects.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches</strong> were suggested to mitigate secondary pest risks.</li>
<li><strong>Policy and risk assessment frameworks</strong> were evaluated for improving regulatory oversight of GM crop cultivation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The findings contribute to evidence-based decision-making in sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation.</p>

As of <strong>mid-2024</strong>, only <strong>32 targets (21%) are on track</strong>, while <strong>64 targets (41%) require acceleration</strong> to meet 2030 goals. <strong>15 targets (10%) show no progress or regression</strong>, and <strong>43 targets (28%) lack sufficient data</strong> for assessment. Although ambitious legislation (e.g., <strong>Fit for 55, Circular Economy Action Plan, Nature Restoration Law</strong>) is expected to drive further progress, <strong>significant gaps remain in energy transition, biodiversity protection, and pollution reduction</strong>.</p>

<h2>Synthesising Results of Meta-Analyses to Inform Policy: A Comparison of Fast-Track Methods</h2>
<h3><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>This study assesses different methods for synthesizing meta-analyses (MAs) to provide scientific evidence for environmental and agricultural policy decision-making. With the exponential increase in MAs, conflicting conclusions often arise, necessitating efficient synthesis methods. The paper evaluates three fast-track methods&mdash;Second-Order Meta-Analysis (SOMA), Most Accurate Meta-Analysis (MAMA), and Vote Counting of Meta-Analysis Results (COMA)&mdash;and compares them against a global meta-analysis of primary data (REMA). Using simulated data, the study finds that SOMA and COMA yield conclusions similar to REMA when redundancy between first-order MAs is low. However, biases in first-order MAs can significantly impact reliability. The study highlights the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in evidence synthesis, with policy relevance implications.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Summary</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Research Problem</strong></h4>
<p>Environmental and agricultural policymaking increasingly relies on meta-analyses, yet multiple MAs on a given topic can present conflicting conclusions. Decision-makers often require rapid evidence synthesis, but traditional methods are time-consuming. This study evaluates fast-track synthesis approaches and their reliability.</p>
<h4><strong>Methodology</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Methods Evaluated:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second-Order Meta-Analysis (SOMA):</strong> Computes a weighted average of first-order MAs' mean effect sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Most Accurate Meta-Analysis (MAMA):</strong> Selects the MA with the lowest coefficient of variation.</li>
<li><strong>Vote Counting of MA Results (COMA):</strong> Classifies MAs into positive, negative, or no-effect categories based on significance.</li>
<li><strong>Reference Meta-Analysis (REMA):</strong> Aggregates all primary data from first-order MAs, serving as the benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Simulated Data:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Generated to evaluate accuracy under different conditions (e.g., effect size, redundancy between MAs, publication bias).</li>
<li>720 scenarios tested, covering varying numbers of first-order MAs, sample sizes, redundancy levels, and bias conditions.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Probability of Correct Conclusion (PCC):</strong> Accuracy in determining effect direction.</li>
<li><strong>Bias and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):</strong> Accuracy of effect size estimation.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence Interval Coverage (CCI):</strong> Reliability of effect size confidence intervals.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Findings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance of Methods:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>REMA consistently delivers the most accurate results but is time-intensive.</li>
<li>SOMA provides reasonable estimates but loses accuracy when MAs share redundant primary data.</li>
<li>MAMA is prone to bias, often selecting extreme effect sizes.</li>
<li>COMA lacks statistical power but is reliable in detecting the absence of effects.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Impact of Publication Bias:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Selective publication of studies with significant effects skews results.</li>
<li>Bias favoring positive effects leads to incorrect conclusions in all methods.</li>
<li>Bias impact is most severe in MAMA, which tends to amplify extreme findings.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Conclusions</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>SOMA and COMA</strong> can serve as practical alternatives for fast-track synthesis when primary data are unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>MAMA is unreliable</strong>, particularly in the presence of bias.</li>
<li><strong>Policy decisions should prioritize REMA</strong>, but when time-constrained, <strong>SOMA with careful quality checks is the best alternative</strong>.</li>
</ul>
