				<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">My PhD research centered on assessing the cost-benefit impacts of genetically modified crops on agro-ecosystems, particularly within the context of European Union (EU) policies such as Directive 2015/412. This directive emphasizes sustainable agricultural practices, biodiversity conservation, and reducing dependency on pesticides. To support these objectives, I developed a spatially explicit bioeconomic modeling framework. This innovative model employed advanced tools, including R, Python, and QGIS, to evaluate how invasive pest outbreaks impact crop productivity, farm economics, pesticide usage, and biodiversity in the Aragon region of Spain. By integrating ecological dynamics with farmer decision-making, my research identified strategies to optimize land use, reduce pesticide reliance, and enhance ecosystem services, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.</span>
